All images are printed exactly as shown to order. Old photos and other vintage media sometimes have a bit of blur which we are careful to keep, as we do with the creases in film posters or antique maps so that your print will still carry with it the true character of the original. All prints are carefully rolled for shipping and safely inserted in a high quality shipping tube. When purchased with a frame, we frame the print for you and it is shipped in a high quality shipping box especially designed for frames to ensure it gets to you in mint condition.",

"policy_shipping": "*SHIPPING INFO* *****PLEASE READ*****\r\n\r\nI ship orders out one to two times a week. Less or more depending on the number of orders completed and processing. I ship first class with USPS. I usually pay the extra dollar for tracking numbers and you will receive yours via email. I do not purchase tracking numbers for international orders (they can cost around $30, unless you would like to pay this fee for the international tracking number) but I do provide a customs form number which is automatically  given for international packages. I am more than happy to express mail packages, but you will be expected to cover the additional shipping costs and I must be notified of requiring express mail at time of purchase.\r\n\r\n**Please let me know upon purchasing a garment if you will need it express mailed to you. Often I receive messages/emails later than this that an order is needed for a birthday or event sooner. This is usually not an issue as processing times are just a few days for most orders and are shipped out quite fast, but please let me know regardless if you have any special request and I will be happy to express mail. Again, you will be expected to cover any additional shipping charges.**\r\n\r\nRegarding shipping costs - I list costs as fairly and accurately as I possibly can. Both shipping and handling are taken into consideration for this. Please know that I keep shipping prices as fair and accurate as I possibly can for you the customer and so that I can keep this shop up and running! \r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL ORDERS -  If a tax is imposed on you by your post office/government it is completely out of my control. I pay the full amount of postage asked at USPS when I ship out.  Please be aware of the taxes required of you when ordering from oversea locations, as it is your responsibility. If you do not wish to pay this tax your post office will hold the package for a certain amount of time and then send it back to me. After this I will not issue a refund and I cannot ship it back to you unless you pay for shipping. \r\n\r\nCustomers are responsible for taxes and duties in their own country, I will not mark parcels as &#39;Gifts&#39; or lower the price on the item so a customer can avoid taxes. This is illegal and all requests to do so will be refused. \r\n*****",
"policy_refunds": "*REFUNDS & EXCHANGES*\r\n\r\nRegarding Returns: I only accept returns for garments that are not custom or have been made with special requests. For example, if you requested to have a certain design featured in my shop printed onto another garment outside of the product listing photos, then this will be considered a custom order and will not qualify for a return. I include as much sizing information, measurements, and any other important details to size, fit, and appearance of the garment so that this is all made clear in each listing before purchase. If your order qualifies for a return, you MUST send the garment back to me within 14 DAYS after receiving it. I can confirm all of this through tracking information and confirmation of delivery. The garment must be in the impeccable condition (unworn) that it was sent out to you in.\r\n\r\nRegarding Exchanges: Sometimes little flip flops arise and if I have accidentally sent you the wrong size or garment then I will be happy to do an exchange and I will take care of all the shipping costs. The faulty garment will have to be sent back to me before completing the exchange, however. ",
"policy_additional": "*CARE & WASH INSTRUCTIONS* \r\n\r\nYou will receive information on how to care for your garment(s) along with your package. Digitally printed garments are totally machine washable, and you can toss them in the dryer as well. Garments printed by heat press can be machine washed, but I do advise to wash them by hand, and to also let air dry. (If you do choose to wash and dry items printed by heat press always use gentle settings and only a little detergent for the wash.) \r\n\r\nHandmade Lingerie: Hand wash with a small amount of mild detergent. An easy and quick trick for washing and handling lingerie and delicates is to wash them in the shower. \r\n\r\n*SIZING INFORMATION* \r\n\r\nI am stocking and listing a fairly good variety of garments now. Each listing contains sizing information and measurements. I will soon be listing that information here as well for every individual style garment available in my shop. ",

I try to reuse boxes and materials instead of buying new and cluttering up our landfills. :) Everything comes from a smoke-free home.\r\n\r\nI typically wrap things in newspaper as it is more sturdy and protective than tissue paper.

If by the 2nd time you do not receive it or it gets lost again I would recommend an alternative address for me to ship to.\r\nI want my customers to be 100% satisfied.

I do wholesale too just contact me for details.\r\n\r\nWholesale FAQ&#39;s:\r\n\r\n&quot;Do you do wholesale?&quot;\r\nYes I do! I just need proof of your tax ID number to do resale for my accounting.\r\n\r\n&quot;What are your prices for wholesale?&quot;\r\nEverything in my store is set at retail price and to figure out the wholesale price just divide by 2 and that&#39;s 50% off of the retail price. This is standard wholesale pricing. For example if I have something listed at $9.99 then the wholesale price would be $4.99. Depending on how much product you order I could give more of a discount than that. ALL pendant wholesale orders come with free chains for each pendant. They are also packaged in organza bags!\r\n\r\n&quot;What is your minimum wholesale order?&quot;\r\nAfter applying your 50% discount the total has to amount to $100 total to qualify for wholesale. So if you ordered pendants at 4.99 each for your $100 order you will be receiving 20 pendants!\r\n\r\n&quot;How do I order wholesale from your Etsy store?&quot;\r\nRight now Etsy doesn&#39;t have a special way to order wholesale so instead when we have everything worked out I will give you a coupon code for 50% off so that you can order everything you want VERY easily. \r\n\r\n&quot;How much is shipping?&quot;\r\nShipping in the USA and Canada is FREE via USPS and comes with a tracking number. If you need an order shipped outside these 2 countries please let me know before ordering so I can give you an estimate. If you want it shipped via UPS let me know and I&#39;ll get you an estimate.\r\nIT CAN TAKE UP TO 2 MONTHS TO RECEIVE YOUR ORDER IF ORDERING OUTSIDE OF THE USA OR CANADA. If you want your items sooner, let me know BEFORE ordering so that we can work out another way to ship them. You will be charged extra for this service.\r\n\r\n&quot;How long does it take to complete an order?&quot;\r\nSince I hand make everything myself it takes at least 2 weeks to complete your order. Very large orders or special needs orders can take longer especially around the holidays such as Christmas. Let me know what you&#39;re interested in and we&#39;ll go from there on an estimate of time.\r\nIT CAN TAKE UP TO 2 MONTHS TO RECEIVE YOUR ORDER IF ORDERING OUTSIDE OF THE USA OR CANADA.

As always, my goal is for you to be completely and utterly thrilled by your purchase!&quot;\r\n\r\nAs seen in my shop announcement:\r\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: If you have a special deadline please let me know before buying so that I can try to help you out. There is absolutely no guaranteed timeline for custom artwork since I must always rely on the customer to provide feedback on proofs within a timely manner. I want you to be 100% satisfied with your handmade product. Please convo me if anything is wrong or not what you expected. I&#39;m happy to offer refunds and exchanges. \r\n\r\nCheck out my blog for more information on my art:\r\n \r\nhttp://www.jbirdistheword.com\r\n\r\nJoin my facebook page for new artwork and updates:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Jbirdistheword\r\n\r\n&quot;Official Etsy Massacre Team Member: Search &quot;EtsyMassacre&quot; for horror movie inspired art and creations made by team members of the Etsy Massacre Team!

"policy_additional": "If you would like to feature me on your blog or other venue please contact me as I love the exposure! I do wholesale too just contact me for details.\r\n\r\nWholesale FAQ&#39;s:\r\n\r\n&quot;Do you do wholesale?&quot;\r\nYes I do! I just need proof of your tax ID number to do resale for my accounting.\r\n\r\n&quot;What are your prices for wholesale?&quot;\r\nEverything in my store is set at retail price and to figure out the wholesale price just divide by 2 and that&#39;s 50% off of the retail price. This is standard wholesale pricing. For example if I have something listed at $9.99 then the wholesale price would be $4.99. Depending on how much product you order I could give more of a discount than that. ALL pendant wholesale orders come with free chains for each pendant. They are also packaged in organza bags!\r\n\r\n&quot;What is your minimum wholesale order?&quot;\r\nAfter applying your 50% discount the total has to amount to $100 total to qualify for wholesale. So if you ordered pendants at 4.99 each for your $100 order you will be receiving 20 pendants!\r\n\r\n&quot;How do I order wholesale from your Etsy store?&quot;\r\nRight now Etsy doesn&#39;t have a special way to order wholesale so instead when we have everything worked out I will give you a coupon code for 50% off so that you can order everything you want VERY easily. \r\n\r\n&quot;How much is shipping?&quot;\r\nShipping in the USA and Canada is FREE via USPS and comes with a tracking number. If you need an order shipped outside these 2 countries please let me know before ordering so I can give you an estimate. If you want it shipped via UPS let me know and I&#39;ll get you an estimate.\r\nIT CAN TAKE UP TO 2 MONTHS TO RECEIVE YOUR ORDER IF ORDERING OUTSIDE OF THE USA OR CANADA. If you want your items sooner, let me know BEFORE ordering so that we can work out another way to ship them. You will be charged extra for this service.\r\n\r\n&quot;How long does it take to complete an order?&quot;\r\nSince I hand make everything myself it takes at least 2 weeks to complete your order. Very large orders or special needs orders can take longer especially around the holidays such as Christmas. Let me know what you&#39;re interested in and we&#39;ll go from there on an estimate of time.\r\nIT CAN TAKE UP TO 2 MONTHS TO RECEIVE YOUR ORDER IF ORDERING OUTSIDE OF THE USA OR CANADA.

"description": "Are you the biggest classic horror nut you know?  Or do you have that friend who is absolutely OBSESSED with Halloween?  Look no further, because these monster hearts are for you!  Each heart is made with little details which connect them to their old Hollywood inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe Vampire heart comes complete with large blood dripping fangs, as well as eerie glowing eyes.\r\n\r\nFranky has stichted forehead, classic jagged edge hair, and bolts in his neck to round out the look.\r\n\r\nOur Witch comes with a little black pointed hat and green nose—complete with warts!\r\n\r\nJack-o, our beloved Jack-o-Lantern has a crooked smile to match his crooked stem.\r\n\r\nOur Wolfman—we like to call him Rolf—comes complete with spiked eyebrows and chin-fur.\r\n\r\nWhich leaves the Ghost for last.  During daylight hours, he seems somewhat ordinary.  But beware!  Once the lights go out he glows!\r\n\r\nEach heart is handmade in the USA from polymer clay and acrylic paint.  Gloss finished (not shown in photo).  Each pendant comes with a long chain—large enough for an adult.",

"description": "Ever wonder what a zombie&#39;s breath would smell like?  It might surprise you :)\r\n\r\nHandmade and handcut, our soaps may vary in size, shape and color. \r\n-Each bar weighs between 4.5 oz and 5.0 oz. The dimensions are approximately 3.25 inches tall, 2.25 inches wide, and 1.0 inches thick. \r\n\r\nINGREDIENTS: Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Castor Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Shea Butter, Distilled Water, Lye*, Kaolin Clay, Fragrance, Glycerin Soap Base, Pigments, Micas, Cosmetic Safe Glitter\r\n\r\n*Used as a saponifying agent to turn oils into &quot;true&quot; soap. All &quot;true&quot; natural soaps made from scratch are made with oils and an alkali salt (lye). Our superfatting method ensures that lye is no longer present or active in the final product.\r\n_______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nPurple Lily Studio artisan soaps are handmade in small batches, with quality ingredients for a natural cleansing experience. \r\n\r\nDue to the high glycerin content of our soaps, we recommend storing them out of the reach of running water. To extend shelf life, store the soap between usages on a soap deck, preferably on a window ledge or a well-ventilated area. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: The statements presented above are for educational purposes only and have not been evaluated by the FDA. The products offered on this website are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any diseases. \r\n\r\nIf you are allergic to any of the ingredients listed, you may have an allergic reaction to our products. To test for allergies, rub and foam the soap sparingly along the inside of your elbow. Wash off and wait for 24 hours to check for any reaction that you may have before use.\r\n\r\nThank you for stopping by!",

Here is some background info on me:\r\n\r\nI attended the Art Institute of Pittsburgh from 2000-2003 and graduated with a degree in animation. Pretty cool huh? I mostly freelance out of my house and do various things such as photography, graphic design, and coming up with stuff to sell on the internet using my artwork.

I do wholesale too just contact me for details.\r\n\r\nWholesale FAQ&#39;s:\r\n\r\n&quot;Do you do wholesale?&quot;\r\nYes I do! I just need proof of your tax ID number to do resale for my accounting.\r\n\r\n&quot;What are your prices for wholesale?&quot;\r\nEverything in my store is set at retail price and to figure out the wholesale price just divide by 2 and that&#39;s 50% off of the retail price. This is standard wholesale pricing. For example if I have something listed at $9.99 then the wholesale price would be $4.99. Depending on how much product you order I could give more of a discount than that. ALL pendant wholesale orders come with free chains for each pendant. They are also packaged in organza bags!\r\n\r\n&quot;What is your minimum wholesale order?&quot;\r\nAfter applying your 50% discount the total has to amount to $100 total to qualify for wholesale. So if you ordered pendants at 4.99 each for your $100 order you will be receiving 20 pendants!\r\n\r\n&quot;How do I order wholesale from your Etsy store?&quot;\r\nRight now Etsy doesn&#39;t have a special way to order wholesale so instead when we have everything worked out I will give you a coupon code for 50% off so that you can order everything you want VERY easily. \r\n\r\n&quot;How much is shipping?&quot;\r\nShipping in the USA and Canada is FREE via USPS and comes with a tracking number. If you need an order shipped outside these 2 countries please let me know before ordering so I can give you an estimate. If you want it shipped via UPS let me know and I&#39;ll get you an estimate.\r\nIT CAN TAKE UP TO 2 MONTHS TO RECEIVE YOUR ORDER IF ORDERING OUTSIDE OF THE USA OR CANADA. If you want your items sooner, let me know BEFORE ordering so that we can work out another way to ship them. You will be charged extra for this service.\r\n\r\n&quot;How long does it take to complete an order?&quot;\r\nSince I hand make everything myself it takes at least 2 weeks to complete your order. Very large orders or special needs orders can take longer especially around the holidays such as Christmas. Let me know what you&#39;re interested in and we&#39;ll go from there on an estimate of time.\r\nIT CAN TAKE UP TO 2 MONTHS TO RECEIVE YOUR ORDER IF ORDERING OUTSIDE OF THE USA OR CANADA.

I&#39;m sure the first question you have is &quot;Do you really make all of your pendants?&quot; The answer is YES I do! I purchase the rights to the artwork, all the supplies, and spend lots of time in my home studio making them to perfection. I also have photography for sale, and I&#39;m starting to design and print T-shirts. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: If you have a special deadline please let me know before buying so that I can try to help you out. There is absolutely no guaranteed timeline for custom artwork since I must always rely on the customer to provide feedback on proofs within a timely manner. I want you to be 100% satisfied with your handmade product. Please convo me if anything is wrong or not what you expected. I&#39;m happy to offer refunds and exchanges. \r\n\r\nContact me if you have any special requests.\r\nWholesale orders are welcome just contact me.\r\n\r\nCheck out my blog for more information on my art:\r\n \r\nhttp://www.jbirdistheword.com\r\n\r\nJoin my facebook page for new artwork and updates:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Jbirdistheword\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks for visiting my store. Here is some background info on me:\r\n\r\nI attended the Art Institute of Pittsburgh from 2000-2003 and graduated with a degree in animation. Pretty cool huh? I mostly freelance out of my house and do various things such as photography, graphic design, and coming up with stuff to sell on the internet using my artwork. I love what I do and I hope you love what I have to offer! Feel free to ask me questions or ask for special products. I&#39;ll try and help you as much as I possibly can.

I try to reuse boxes and materials instead of buying new and cluttering up our landfills. :) Everything comes from a smoke-free home.\r\n\r\nI typically wrap things in newspaper as it is more sturdy and protective than tissue paper. Pendants and magnets come in nice organza bags and prints are in plastic sleeves with acid free boards.\r\n\r\nIf however you have a special deadline please convo me prior to ordering and I&#39;ll try my hardest to make sure you can get your order before you need it.",

If by the 2nd time you do not receive it or it gets lost again I would recommend an alternative address for me to ship to.\r\nI want my customers to be 100% satisfied. Just let me know what you want me to do to achieve that. Please purchase seriously.",
"policy_additional": "If you would like to feature me on your blog or other venue please contact me as I love the exposure! I do wholesale too just contact me for details.\r\n\r\nWholesale FAQ&#39;s:\r\n\r\n&quot;Do you do wholesale?&quot;\r\nYes I do! I just need proof of your tax ID number to do resale for my accounting.\r\n\r\n&quot;What are your prices for wholesale?&quot;\r\nEverything in my store is set at retail price and to figure out the wholesale price just divide by 2 and that&#39;s 50% off of the retail price. This is standard wholesale pricing. For example if I have something listed at $9.99 then the wholesale price would be $4.99. Depending on how much product you order I could give more of a discount than that. ALL pendant wholesale orders come with free chains for each pendant. They are also packaged in organza bags!\r\n\r\n&quot;What is your minimum wholesale order?&quot;\r\nAfter applying your 50% discount the total has to amount to $100 total to qualify for wholesale. So if you ordered pendants at 4.99 each for your $100 order you will be receiving 20 pendants!\r\n\r\n&quot;How do I order wholesale from your Etsy store?&quot;\r\nRight now Etsy doesn&#39;t have a special way to order wholesale so instead when we have everything worked out I will give you a coupon code for 50% off so that you can order everything you want VERY easily. \r\n\r\n&quot;How much is shipping?&quot;\r\nShipping in the USA and Canada is FREE via USPS and comes with a tracking number. If you need an order shipped outside these 2 countries please let me know before ordering so I can give you an estimate. If you want it shipped via UPS let me know and I&#39;ll get you an estimate.\r\nIT CAN TAKE UP TO 2 MONTHS TO RECEIVE YOUR ORDER IF ORDERING OUTSIDE OF THE USA OR CANADA. If you want your items sooner, let me know BEFORE ordering so that we can work out another way to ship them. You will be charged extra for this service.\r\n\r\n&quot;How long does it take to complete an order?&quot;\r\nSince I hand make everything myself it takes at least 2 weeks to complete your order. Very large orders or special needs orders can take longer especially around the holidays such as Christmas. Let me know what you&#39;re interested in and we&#39;ll go from there on an estimate of time.\r\nIT CAN TAKE UP TO 2 MONTHS TO RECEIVE YOUR ORDER IF ORDERING OUTSIDE OF THE USA OR CANADA.

The dimensions are approximately 3.25 inches tall, 2.25 inches wide, and 1.0 inches thick. \r\n\r\nINGREDIENTS: Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Castor Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Shea Butter, Distilled Water, Lye*, Kaolin Clay, Fragrance, Pigments, Micas, Cosmetic Safe Glitter\r\n\r\n*Used as a saponifying agent to turn oils into &quot;true&quot; soap. All &quot;true&quot; natural soaps made from scratch are made with oils and an alkali salt (lye). Our superfatting method ensures that lye is no longer present or active in the final product.\r\n_______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nPurple Lily Studio artisan soaps are handmade in small batches, with quality ingredients for a natural cleansing experience. \r\n\r\nDue to the high glycerin content of our soaps, we recommend storing them out of the reach of running water. To extend shelf life, store the soap between usages on a soap deck, preferably on a window ledge or a well-ventilated area. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: The statements presented above are for educational purposes only and have not been evaluated by the FDA. The products offered on this website are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any diseases. \r\n\r\nIf you are allergic to any of the ingredients listed, you may have an allergic reaction to our products. To test for allergies, rub and foam the soap sparingly along the inside of your elbow. Wash off and wait for 24 hours to check for any reaction that you may have before use.\r\n\r\nThank you for stopping by!",

"description": "This 3D printed Golden antler skull design was modeled and printed by the artist. This is a wonderful decorative piece that is a great conversation starter. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe antler skull is approximately 5.75&#39;&#39; Tall (to top of antlers)  x  4.75 deep(from teeth to back of antler) x 6.75&#39;&#39; wide (from antler to antler) \r\n\r\nThe antler skull is printed from Eco friendly PLA bio plastic. This is not meant as a toy and is only decorative. It should not be placed in a hot car as this will weaken the PLA. \r\n\r\nThere will be a few rough patches on the bottom of this design due to the overhangs please check the images above to see them. \r\n\r\nSculptures ship USPS mail. International buyers please contact me for shipping quotes. \r\n\r\nAll concepts and designs are copyrighted by Malcontent Mandrake.\r\n© 2009 - 2014 Malcontent Mandrake",
